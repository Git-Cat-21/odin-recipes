        <p>White sauce pasta is a creamy and delicious Italian dish made with pasta and a rich, velvety white sauce. The sauce, known as BÃ©chamel, is typically made from butter, flour, and milk, creating a smooth and flavorful base.

The pasta, usually varieties like penne, fettuccine, or spaghetti, is cooked until al dente and then tossed in the white sauce. Vegetables, chicken, or seafood can be added for extra flavor and texture. White sauce pasta is a comforting and indulgent meal enjoyed by many around the world.</p>
