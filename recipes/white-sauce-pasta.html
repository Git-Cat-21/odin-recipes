    <p>White sauce pasta is a <b>creamy and delicious</b> Italian dish made with pasta and a rich, velvety white sauce. The
        sauce, known as Béchamel, is typically made from butter, flour, and milk, creating a smooth and flavorful base.
        It is often seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and can be enhanced with ingredients like garlic, cheese, or
        herbs. The pasta, usually varieties like penne, fettuccine, or spaghetti, is cooked until al dente and then
        tossed in the white sauce. Vegetables, chicken, or seafood can be added for extra flavor and texture. White
        sauce pasta is a comforting and indulgent meal enjoyed by many around the world.</p>
